        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>CITK (Customer is the King) is a game-changing startup that aims to provide affordable and high-quality cooking services. Founded by Kushagra Chadha and Ayush Ranjan, CITK is on a mission to transform the culinary landscape by offering customers the royal treatment they deserve. This is the story of how their startup came to be, the challenges they faced, and the triumphs they achieved along the way.

            In the beginning, Kushagra and Ayush, both passionate food enthusiasts, noticed a gap in the market. They realized that many people desired delicious and diverse meals but lacked the time or culinary expertise to prepare them. Inspired by this observation, they envisioned a platform where anyone could access talented cooks at an affordable rate, bringing gourmet dining experiences right to their doorsteps.
            
            The journey to bring their vision to life was not without its hurdles. As entrepreneurs, Kushagra and Ayush faced numerous challenges, including sourcing skilled cooks, building a strong customer base, and establishing a reliable supply chain for fresh ingredients. They also encountered resistance from skeptics who doubted the viability of their business model.
            
            Undeterred, Kushagra and Ayush poured their hearts and souls into overcoming these obstacles. They tirelessly sought out talented chefs, rigorously vetted their skills, and assembled a team of passionate culinary experts. By nurturing strong relationships with local suppliers, they ensured a consistent supply of top-notch ingredients. Simultaneously, they focused on building a robust online platform, leveraging technology to streamline the entire process, from booking a cook to personalized menu customization.
            
            As Kushagra and Ayush reflect on their journey, they are immensely proud of the impact CITK has had on people's lives. By putting the customer at the center of everything they do, they have successfully transformed the way people think about home-cooked meals. CITK's story is a testament to the power of perseverance, innovation, and the belief that when it comes to food, the customer truly is the king.</p>
